  -- Why is the correct answer to mappend the
  -- function with the value? I thought "...we have
  -- to map our function over the argument that
  -- gets discarded. So there is no value to map
  -- over, and the function application doesnâ€™t
  -- happen." And shouldn't we not modify the 
  -- structure? Here, the structure is altered
  -- via mappend (while staying the in the same
  -- closed set). And for Constant, there's
  -- nothing but structure.
