-- Notice the difference in expansion between foldr and foldl.
-- Thus something like:
-- foldr const 0 [1..5]
-- doesn't traverse the entire spine, but something like:
-- foldl const 0 [1..5]
-- still has to. I think.
-- Also, it looks like foldl is tail call recursive.

foldl f (f [] 1) [2,3]
foldl f (f (f [] 1) 2) [3]
foldl f (f (f (f [] 1) 2) 3) []
(f (f (f [] 1) 2) 3) 

f 1 (foldr f z [2,3])
f 1 (f 2 (foldr f z [3]))
f 1 (f 2 (f 3 (foldr f z [])))
f 1 (f 2 (f 3 []))
